<div class="famfontR orange-lineR"></div></div> 
	<div class="content-details">
	<p class="leada">My name is Mikaíl Rashid, and I am the owner of Rashid Family Law, Legal Technician in King County, Washington, where I practice exclusively in Superior Court. I am passionate about helping people resolve their family law disputes.</p>
	</div>
<h5 class="wow" style="visibility: visible;">Journey to Practicing Law:</h5>
<p class="leada">I became interested in family law after struggling personally with a child support modification. As I completed my forms, there were many errors needing correction. Every law clerk I asked for assistance told me they could not give legal advice and consult an attorney. I could not afford an attorney, and at that time, there were few, if any, pro bono (free) services available to low-income persons like me.</p>
<p class="leada">After years of trial and error, I finally got a judge to sign my orders.
While preparing my child support modification, I spoke to many African American men with children in similar situations (court-ordered child support based on imputed and speculative income standards). African-American men struggling through the legal system is the impetus for opening a collaborative law practice
</p>
<h5 class="wow" style="visibility: visible;">Mission:</h5>
<p class="leada">At Rashid Family Law, our mission is to provide an alternative means to the traditional and costly approach to resolve family matters through the collaborative law process.</p>
<h5 class="wow" style="visibility: visible;">Collaborative Law Process:</h5>
<p class="leada">The parties create an agreement without going to trial by negotiating a just and equitable agreement where both parties are satisfied with the outcome and in the child’s best interest.
Today, I am honored to be the sole practitioner at Rashid Family Law, Legal Technician. I coordinate with other professionals, including attorneys, financial consultants, guardian ad litem, and family therapists, to identify an equitable and just agreement for my clients. I aim to help families and individuals in need of legal assistance, giving them an alternative to the inherent costly traditional courtroom battles with a collaborative law approach to dispute resolution.</p>

			<h1 class="section-title wow fadeInUpQuick animated famfont">What Is Collaborative Practice?</h1>
			<p class="section-subcontent">Collaborative Practice is a voluntary dispute resolution process in which parties settle without resorting to litigation. In Collaborative Practice: The parties sign a collaborative participation agreement describing the nature and scope of the matter; The parties voluntarily disclose all information that is relevant and material to the matter that must be decided; The parties agree to use good faith efforts in their negotiations to reach a mutually acceptable settlement; Each party must be represented by a lawyer whose representation terminates upon the undertaking of any contested court proceeding; The parties may engage mental health and financial professionals whose engagement terminates upon the undertaking of any contested court proceeding; and The parties may jointly engage other experts as needed. Collaborative Practice provides you and your spouse or partner with the support and guidance of your lawyers without going to court. Additionally, Collaborative Practice allows you the benefit of coaches,children, and financial specialists all working together with you on your team. In Collaborative Practice, core elements form your commitments to this process, which are to: Negotiate a mutually acceptable resolution without having courts decide issues. Maintain open communication and information sharing. Create shared solutions acknowledging the highest priorities of all.</p> </div>
