				<!--h1 class="section-title wow fadeInUpQuick animated famfont">What Is Collaborative Practice?</h1>
				<p class="section-subcontent">Collaborative Practice is a voluntary dispute resolution process in which parties settle without resorting to litigation. In Collaborative Practice: The parties sign a collaborative participation agreement describing the nature and scope of the matter; The parties voluntarily disclose all information that is relevant and material to the matter that must be decided; The parties agree to use good faith efforts in their negotiations to reach a mutually acceptable settlement; Each party must be represented by a lawyer whose representation terminates upon the undertaking of any contested court proceeding; The parties may engage mental health and financial professionals whose engagement terminates upon the undertaking of any contested court proceeding; and The parties may jointly engage other experts as needed. Collaborative Practice provides you and your spouse or partner with the support and guidance of your lawyers without going to court. Additionally, Collaborative Practice allows you the benefit of coaches,children, and financial specialists all working together with you on your team. In Collaborative Practice, core elements form your commitments to this process, which are to: Negotiate a mutually acceptable resolution without having courts decide issues. Maintain open communication and information sharing. Create shared solutions acknowledging the highest priorities of all.</p-->

					<p class="lead">We recognize and appreciate that not all individuals facing divorce need, want, and/or can afford to have a lawyer handle all aspects of their divorce on their behalf. One way to limit lawyer involvement (and reduce legal fees) is to limit the things your lawyer is asked to do for you. As skilled, experienced practitioners, we understand that clients can be well-served, even if we limit the scope of our work.</p>
					<p class="lead">Rather than having your practitioner provide the full “bundle” of things that lawyers do, (such as gather information, provide legal advice, negotiate, draft papers, go to court, etc.) you can perform some tasks on your own while asking Rashid Family Law to do the things that you need a lawyer to do for you.</p>
					<p class="lead">For example, you can gather your own information and even gather information from your spouse and negotiate some of your issues, and then have Rashid Family Law advise you on other issues, negotiate a final resolution and draft the final papers.

		Your One-Stop for Designing a Solution for your Family
		</h1>
		<p class="section-subcontent famparac">Mediation can mean many things, from a simple one-meeting mediation process to integrating a team of professionals to address all of your family's needs.
		Which way is best? The best method of mediation depends on you and the particular needs of your family. To help you think about how to make the best choice for your family, let's break it down.
		At its core, mediation is a method of resolving divorce issues with the help of a neutral person (or persons). The mediator would not represent either you or your spouse individually but is committed to helping you reach agreements on issues.

			One Mediation Session
			</h1>
			<p class="section-subcontent famparac">
			At its most basic, mediation could mean simply sitting down with us for two hours to work on helping you design your family plan. If you do have relatively simple issues, or if you have reached agreements on most issues, it is possible to get them done in one meeting. In those cases, you immediately move on to drafting your final agreement in a format the court will approve. <br><br><br>

			Multiple Mediation Sessions
			</h1>
			<p class="section-subcontent famparac">
			Most mediations require more than just one session. It is not uncommon for couples to spend between three and six sessions (2-3 hours each) with the mediator. That is not necessarily bad news. More can be better. You want to develop a life plan that truly works for many years, maybe even decades, and slowing down to get it right is often a very wise investment. Often our most satisfied clients are those who spent many sessions developing a plan that truly works.

						<p class="sup-description">Many couples choose to have lawyers help them through mediation. In fact, for the reasons described below, we recommend some practitioner's involvement in almost all cases. However, as always, the choice is yours. Here are ways that lawyers can help you find your best outcome.</p>
						<div class="tabsecs"></div><p>Drafting (creating a document that you can send to the judge): Mediation, when successful, usually ends with a Mediation Memorandum that describes all of your agreements. While this memorandum completes the mediation process, the next step is getting your agreement (and the divorce) approved by a Washington Court judge. This means drafting a separate legal document to be filed with the court. Under Washington Court rules, the mediator cannot draft that document. Therefore, the final legal papers will need to be drafted by one of the parties or by a lawyer.   </p>
						<div class="tabsecs"></div><p>For people who want to draft their own papers, the Washington Supreme Court and many local counties provide forms and other resources. In addition, our Mediation Memorandum will be prepared in a manner that makes it relatively easy to convert to a final legal document. Consequently, parties can prepare their own papers, and an increasing number of people choose that option.</p>
						<div class="tabsecs"></div><p>However, if your case involves minor children or significant financial issues, we strongly recommend that you consider having a lawyer prepare the final papers. The final documents that you submit to the court could affect your lives, and the lives of your children, for many years.</p>
						<div class="tabsecs"></div><p>Making sure that your paperwork accurately reflects your intentions could save you money and anguish in the future. It is essential to know that you can find an attorney to draft your paperwork at a fairly minimal cost.  </p>

<div class="famfontR orange-lineR"></div></div> 
	<div class="content-details">
	<p class="leada">My name is Mikaíl Rashid, and I am the owner of Rashid Family Law, Legal Technician in King County, Washington, where I practice exclusively in Superior Court. I am passionate about helping people resolve their family law disputes.</p>
	</div>
<h5 class="wow" style="visibility: visible;">Journey to Practicing Law:</h5>
<p class="leada">I became interested in family law after struggling personally with a child support modification. As I completed my forms, there were many errors needing correction. Every law clerk I asked for assistance told me they could not give legal advice and consult an attorney. I could not afford an attorney, and at that time, there were few, if any, pro bono (free) services available to low-income persons like me.</p>
<p class="leada">After years of trial and error, I finally got a judge to sign my orders.
While preparing my child support modification, I spoke to many African American men with children in similar situations (court-ordered child support based on imputed and speculative income standards). African-American men struggling through the legal system is the impetus for opening a collaborative law practice
</p>
<h5 class="wow" style="visibility: visible;">Mission:</h5>
<p class="leada">At Rashid Family Law, our mission is to provide an alternative means to the traditional and costly approach to resolve family matters through the collaborative law process.</p>
<h5 class="wow" style="visibility: visible;">Collaborative Law Process:</h5>
<p class="leada">The parties create an agreement without going to trial by negotiating a just and equitable agreement where both parties are satisfied with the outcome and in the child’s best interest.
Today, I am honored to be the sole practitioner at Rashid Family Law, Legal Technician. I coordinate with other professionals, including attorneys, financial consultants, guardian ad litem, and family therapists, to identify an equitable and just agreement for my clients. I aim to help families and individuals in need of legal assistance, giving them an alternative to the inherent costly traditional courtroom battles with a collaborative law approach to dispute resolution.</p>
